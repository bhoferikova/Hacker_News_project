In this project I'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented on. The two types of posts begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

IÂ´ll compare these two types of posts to determine the following questions:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
